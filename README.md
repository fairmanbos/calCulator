# Introduction
Calorie calculator is a program to let users calculate their daily calorie consumption and also their daily calorie burned to evaluate user’s calorie deficit. 
The program will get user’s input on their weight, height, age, and gender. From these inputs, the program can calculate the user’s body mass index (BMI), body fat percentage (BFP), lean body mass (LBM), basal metabolic rate (BMR), and rate of weight loss. 
Basal metabolic rate can also be the daily average calorie needed by the body and this is important for calorie deficit calculation. 
Rate of weight loss is the maximum recommended rate that a user can set as a goal for their daily weight loss.
Calorie consume differs by the type and total amount of foods, drinks any consumables that users take every day. 
An estimate of calorific value for these consumables was taken from researches and a database is made. A database for the amount of calorie burned is also made with the user’s duty or exercise and the time spent for the duty/exercise as variables.

For this project Javafx and Scene Builder was used to create the GUI for the program. 
Through a quick research, a small sample of data was taken to acquired the calorific value of food and drinks consumed and also the calorie burned through an amount of exercise done. 
This data is used to calculate the estiamte total amount of calorie taken or burned by a person in a day. With these data, the estimated calorie deficit can be calculated.

This program is planned to be turned into a mobile application. A mobile application will enable user to access the program easily as user can bring them anywhere.
The interface will be improved to be more stylish and more engaging so user can navigate through the app without any complication. 


#Summary and future plans
Calorie calculator is a mobile application that helps user to manage their dietary plan. By inserting several data, the app can calculate the user’s BMI, BFP, and calorie deficit. 
In the future, this app will help make a guide for users to start their dietary plan depending on their goal whether it is to loss weight, maintain their fitness or for body building. 
It will store the user’s data daily and after a period of time for example a week or a month, the app will show a graphical representation of those data to show whether the user is improving or not. 
It will point out what the user is lacking after it has analyse the user’s data. A big database will be created to store information such as calorific value of food and calorie burned through a certain amount of exercise. 
This database is important to get a more accurate calculation.
